    "Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn. Compared to C or JAVA, the same algorithms can be written in Python with a 30-60% reduction in the number of lines of code. Most code is read more frequently than the time spent developing. Python is easily readable and thus is easily to read and comprehend. It has a large standard library and over 25,000 third party packages. Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. An advantage of OOP is the code is easier to maintain, provide more reusable components and provides good scalability.\n",

There are coding conventions that specify best practices for indentation, maximum line length, use of whitespace and comments that can make the code more easily read by the author, or more importantly, others who would like to re-use your functions.\n",
    "There is a [Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Teams may have their own coding styles or conventions; the goal is to create readable and easily understandable code."
